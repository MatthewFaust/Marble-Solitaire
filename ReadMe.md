Marble Solitaire is a puzzle game played on a cross-shaped board represented as a 2D array. Marbles jump over adjacent marbles into empty spaces, removing the jumped-over marble. The goal is to leave only one marble on the board. The game tracks the board state, valid moves, and game status (ongoing, won, or lost). Players select a marble and a destination to make a move, with the game updating the board and checking for win or lose conditions.
